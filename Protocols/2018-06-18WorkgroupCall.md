## Status Quality Checks
- Jacob wasn't able to check WICE adapter to this point. Tries to check it today/tommorrow.
  - Jacob reviewed the adapter and wrote the documentation for the adapter


## Status Transformer Implementation
- Legal interdependences need to be checked
  - Shterion and Philipp could answer the legal questions and pushed them onto Github
  - Shterion created a first draft of the FAQ: possible problems + how to solve them
  - Shterion wrote a rudimentary documentation for the Wice component
  
 

## Onboarding Workshop
- We will have a workshop within the first two weeks of July (Jacob will be on vac. in 3rd/4th week):
  - Goal: "What do I have to do in order to connect..?"
  - Target group will be developers
  - Idea: Gathering/recording some points of the workshop to do a follow-up, focussing specific questions
