Growth of the Community is important to us. This also means increasing the number of connectors to provide more possible integrations to users of the framework. Therefore we frequently set up funding programmes to support development of connectors.

The last 10 funded Partners are still in the process of development. There are no further funds available right now.

If you are interested in a connector funding, please get in touch via **connector@openintegrationhub.de**
