# Quality Checks Results Template

The purpose of this document is to unify the result format of the adapter quality checks. It provides a template to list all required properties which are currently missing, in order to build an adapter of high quality.
The following sections help to structure the results and divide the required properties in logical coherent topics.

In the first section the general template is provided. In the second section, an exemplary quality check on basis of the template is presented.
